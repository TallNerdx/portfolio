# Docs for You. Happy Users. Increased Profit

I provide value for technology companies or projects (Web 2.0 and Web 3.0) by creating superb documentation for their various needs. Usually, companies and projects I work with have issues in these areas and more:

- Outdated product documentation.
- Lack of clear user tutorials, manuals, and guides.
- Poorly designed documentation portal using docs as code tools.
- Ineffectual knowledge bases.
- Poorly organized internal documentation sets.
- Lack of how-to guides for solving specific user problems.
- Poor user functionality within documentation.

I bring value to companies and projects by solving these issues and more. I approach documentation as a craft where users move from abstract understanding to immediate application on concrete steps that result in positive valued outcomes.

## **So, How Do I Help?**

The work I do to help companies and projects encompasses a broad category, from:

- Designing, building, and deploying documentation portals.
- Writing and editing documentation for developer and user audiences.
- Technical editing and architecture on all levels of your documentation.
- Consultation on technical writing, documentation portal design, and architecture.

## **How I Do Great Work**

I do great work following these guiding principles for all clients:

- Figuring out how things work first as a user, then as a developer.
- Recognizing spots for content to be reused or iterated for fast, meaningful work.
- Aggressively testing documentation usability.
- Providing open-minded opinions.
- Accepting feedback and incorporating it.
- By designing excellent documentation, you can continue maintaining it years later.

Aside from this, I love problems related to information design and architecture. I am proficient in the following languages:

- Python
- Solidity
- HTML
- CSS
- Markdown
  
I am also good at docs as code tools like:

- Docusaurus
- MkDocs Material
- MkDocs
- ReadMe
  
Also, I have extensive experience working for clients with bylines in top companies like [Aviator](https://aviator.co/), [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/docs/how-to-install-anaconda-on-a-windows-server-using-vultr/), and others. You can review my [resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qqmz9wfL6_iZfzzJZxqD9IX9oYWJNdk1SAUG947lcJI/edit) and [portfolio](Portfolio/start%20here.md) to learn more about my experience.
